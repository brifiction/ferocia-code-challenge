# ferocia-code-challenge

This code challenge has been attempted by Brian Ng, to build a simple 'term deposit calculator' application.

For more information, see PDF document for more details.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm i`.
2. Run with `pnpm dev`, browser loads https://localhost:5173.

## Testing

I am using `vitest`, thus you can run `pnpm test` (or with `pnpm test:ui` to use `vitest --ui` feature).
